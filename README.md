## Overview

This repository presents a comprehensive research project on an innovative thermal management system using pressurized CO2 for computing platforms. Originally designed for extreme field conditions, the architecture has evolved to include domestic applications through a novel outdoor deployment model. The system reconceptualizes cooling as a finite, deployable resource - similar to ammunition or fuel in field operations - enabling precise thermal management through multi-modal cooling mechanisms and adaptive control algorithms.
