### Theoretical Foundations

#### 1. Thermodynamic Principles
- **Joule-Thomson Effect**
  - ΔT = μJT·ΔP (μJT ≈ 1.1 K/atm for CO2)
  - Cooling from 60 bar to 1 bar: ΔT = 64.9°C

- **Phase Change Thermodynamics**
  - Latent heat of vaporization: ΔHvap = 321 J/g
  - 12g canister capacity: Q = 3852J theoretical
  - 2900J effective (after efficiency losses)

- **Ideal Gas Behavior**
  - Pressure-temperature relation: P₁/T₁ = P₂/T₂
  - Operating range: 25°C to 80°C
  - 18% pressure enhancement effect

#### 2. Thermoelectric Theory
- Peltier effect modeling
- Temperature-dependent efficiency
- Battery power optimization
