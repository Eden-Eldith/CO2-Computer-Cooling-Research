# Hardware Build Instructions

1. Assemble the sealed chassis using the machined aluminum parts.
2. Install the CO₂ canister bay and verify the safety valve is rated for 3 bar.
3. Mount the ESP32 control board and connect sensors.
4. Test the solenoid valves with short pulses before loading CO₂.

## Troubleshooting

- **Leak Detected**: Check gasket seating and retighten screws.
- **No Cooling**: Ensure the purge valve is functioning and canisters contain CO₂.
- **Sensor Errors**: Verify wiring and sensor addresses on the bus.
